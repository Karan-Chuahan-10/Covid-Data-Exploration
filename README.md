## About The Project
This project provides a data-driven analysis of COVID-19's global impact, focusing on infection, death, and vaccination rates across countries and continents. Using SQL, it examines total cases vs. deaths to assess mortality, tracks vaccination progress with rolling totals, and compares infection rates relative to population sizes. Aggregated views by continent and globally highlight regions most affected, with advanced SQL techniques like CTEs, temporary tables, and views enabling efficient data handling and insightful summaries

## Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel:** Used for data cleaning and preparation, ensuring data accuracy and consistency before further analysis.
- **Tableau:** Employed to create interactive visualizations, allowing an intuitive exploration of global COVID-19 trends and comparisons across regions.
- **SQL:** Utilized to extract, transform, and analyze COVID-19 data from Excel, delivering insights into infection, death, and vaccination rates by location.

## Approach 
- **Data Collection and Preparation:** Excel was used to import, clean, and organize raw data, removing duplicates and standardizing formats to ensure accuracy.

- **Data Transformation and Structuring:** SQL was used to query and aggregate data from Excel, allowing efficient analysis of cases, deaths, and vaccination rates.

- **Building the Dashboard:** Tableau was used to build interactive visualizations that provide insights into COVID-19 trends across countries and continents, enabling data exploration through filters and drill-downs.

- **Designing for Interactivity:** The dashboard incorporates dynamic filters and drill-down options, enhancing user engagement by allowing analysis from various perspectives, such as country, continent, or time period.

- **Testing and Optimization:**  Each visualization was tested for accuracy and optimized for performance to ensure fast loading and responsive interaction, providing users with a seamless experience.

## Key features
- **Data Integration:** Extraction and integration of COVID-19 data from Excel for in-depth analysis.
- **Data Validation and Querying:** SQL querying ensures accurate and consistent data handling, providing reliable insights and metrics.
- **Visualization:** Engaging charts, graphs, and maps in Tableau illustrate trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccination rates.
- **Interactivity:** Includes dynamic filters and drill-down features to explore data by different locations, dates, and population metrics.
- **Global and Continental Insights:** Aggregated data views highlight global and continental COVID-19 impacts, comparing regions with the highest infection and death rates.
- **Population vs. Infection Analysis:** Calculations provide insights into infection rates relative to population, enabling a clear understanding of regional impact.

## Benefits 
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Empowers informed decisions with real-time insights into COVID-19 trends.
- **Enhanced User Engagement:** Allows for intuitive data exploration through interactive filters and visualization.
- **Efficiency and Accuracy:** SQL ensures data accuracy, while the streamlined dashboard offers fast access to insights.
- **Comprehensive Analysis:** Combines data from multiple sources to provide a well-rounded view of global COVID-19 impacts.
- **Flexible Reporting:** Customizable options in Tableau allow users to focus on specific locations, dates, and metrics.
## Status 
- Covid data exploration **Completed**
